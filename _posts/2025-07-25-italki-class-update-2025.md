A quick update on my italki Malayalam lessons! 📚 My special 25% discount offer ends this weekend (July 27th) ⏰. This offer applies to lesson packages of 5, 10, and 15 classes. Please note that each package is valid for six months from purchase date 📅.

After this weekend, new students will see updated pricing, and this current discount will no longer be available 💰.

Great news for my existing students! 🎉 Your current pricing structure will remain unchanged for now.

If you have any questions or need clarification, please feel free to reply to the newsletter email you received 📧. I'm always happy to help! 😊
