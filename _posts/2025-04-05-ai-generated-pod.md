Recently, I came across a YouTube video where a person was using the Google tool _NotebookLM_ to generate a podcast episode. I was intrigued by the idea and decided to try it out myself using the Malayalam language 🌴📻.

I used the same tool to generate a podcast episode in Malayalam. The process was quite simple and straightforward ✨. The topic I chose was **'Njan, Ente, Enikku'** which is a way of saying **'I'** in Malayalam. I added a few YouTube links from **Elikutty**, **Fluent in Malayalam**, and my own notes to generate the episode 📚🔗.

The generated episode was quite interesting and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the content 😍. The AI was able to generate a coherent and engaging episode that _sounded like a real podcast_. I was truly impressed by the capabilities of the AI 🤯.

I did ask a few people to listen to the episode and give me their feedback 🎧🗣️. Most of them were surprised that it was generated by AI and not a real person! They found the content to be **engaging and informative**. However, they were not happy with the pronunciation of a few words 🤔. I think this is a limitation of the AI and it will improve over time as the technology advances ⚙️.

One thing I can guarantee ✅ — the content generated is **absolutely useful** and doesn't contain any misinformation 🙌.

🎧 The full episode is available on my [Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6o1BhB4DafUCdArHXfwfVc?si=rDTikvOhRrqN4qvzSPteKA).

📖 Additionally, I created a **pronunciation guide** for the words that were mispronounced. You can find it here: [Pronunciation Website](https://malayalam-pronunciation.netlify.app/).

💬 I would **love to hear your feedback** on the episode! Let me know if I should continue making more of these or stop it altogether! 🇮🇳💡 Please share your comments under post-100.
