Probably, some of you can already relate to this. But maybe I exaggerated a bit. 😅 Well, there is good news, we are here to change all this!

> Did you know, beginning to speak is just like standing up and walking for the first time? My Goal for you is to change you from 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️ to this -> 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ 🤸

Speaking is the **most important part** of learning a language. You can learn all the grammar rules and vocabulary, but if you can't speak the language, you won't be able to communicate with others. That's why it's important to practice speaking as much as possible. This is one skill that you can't learn by just reading books or watching videos. You have to actually speak the language to get better at it.

For the same reason, I have been a **tutor** on italki since 2020. I have taught **150+** students so far on various level from Beginner to Advanced. I have also helped students with their pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and speaking skills. You can read some testimonials if you scroll down. 😊

It can be frustrating to speak Malayalam for a beginner. But I have made an awesome study plan which includes 10 classes to help you start from the scratch to express simple sentences in Malayalam. Well, that is a good start, right? 😊 For advanced students, I have various activities to help improve expressing thoughts with brevity.

To get you started, I have created a cheat sheet for you to start speaking Malayalam. You can download it for **FREE** from the link below.
